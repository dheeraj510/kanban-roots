# Kanban roots [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/hugomaiavieira/kanban-roots.png)](http://travis-ci.org/hugomaiavieira/kanban-roots)

A kanban board that keep the simplicity as well as the roots of the concept.

## System dependencies

###[pygments](http://pygments.org/)

The pygments is a python package used on markdown syntax highlighting. To
install it, just run:

    $ (sudo) easy_install pygments


## Using on Heroku

If you don't know [heroku](http://heroku.com) yet, just follow the
[Geting Started with Heroku](http://docs.heroku.com/quickstart) guide.

I [add a hack](https://github.com/hugomaiavieira/kanban-roots/commit/e008af61bdcce90f5ff0eb0e2edd359ac206f53c)
for pygments work on Heroku, based on [this post](http://matthewboston.com/posts/3)
from [Matthew Boston](https://github.com/bostonaholic) blog. So, don't worry
about that.

That's it! Simple like that =)
